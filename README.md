# SQL Query Bug: Handling NULL Salary Values

This repository demonstrates a common SQL query error related to NULL values. The original query fails to correctly handle NULL values in the `salary` column, leading to incomplete results.

The `bug.sql` file contains the erroneous query.  The `bugSolution.sql` file shows the corrected query that handles NULL values appropriately.

This example highlights the importance of considering NULLs when writing SQL queries and demonstrates proper handling techniques.
