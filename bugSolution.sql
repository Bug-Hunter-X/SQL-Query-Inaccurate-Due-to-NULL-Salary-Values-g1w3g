```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND (salary > 100000 OR salary IS NULL);
--Alternative solution using COALESCE to handle NULLs
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE department = 'Sales' AND COALESCE(salary, 0) > 100000;
```
The corrected query uses the `OR salary IS NULL` condition to explicitly include employees with NULL salaries. The alternative uses `COALESCE` to replace NULL values with 0 before comparison.  Choose the solution that best suits the specific business logic and data requirements.  If a NULL salary should be treated differently, adjust the query accordingly.
